# ASSIGNMENT
Difference between float and double - Both float and double are data types in many programming languages used to store floating-point numbers such as(3.14, 2.5) etc. Their main difference lies in the level of precision offered. A float offers a single-precision floating point while a double offers a double offers a double-precions of floating-numbers. A double ussually has a high  accuracy than float and thus suitable for scientific calculations compared to a float.


Character and String - A character is a fundamental data type that contains a single letter, integer, punctuation mark or a symbol eg('a', 'B', 5', '!').They are enclosed in single quotes during presentation used for Storing individual characters, parsing text character by character and working with character arrays. Strings on the other hand is not a fundamental data type in C++ but rather a data type in the standard library. eg (std::string).Strings are commonly used for storing words, sentences, file paths, user input, and generally handling any sequence of textual information.

Function of { #include<iostream> Using namespace std; } in C++ - This block of code is mostly seen at the begginning of files in C++.It is used to set up the environment for basic input and output operations.This is a preprocessor directive. The #include part tells the C++ preprocessor to literally insert the entire content of the iostream header file into the current source file before compilation.iostream (Input/Output Stream): This header file contains declarations for the standard input and output stream objects and functions.It provides definitions for objects like std::cout (for output to the console), std::cin (for input from the console), and std::endl (for inserting a newline character and flushing the output buffer).Necessity: Without including iostream, the compiler would not recognize cout, cin, or endl, leading to compilation errors if you try to use them for displaying information or taking user input.

The namespace std; This statement brings all the names (like cout, cin, string, vector, etc.) from the std (standard) namespace into the current scope.In C++, namespaces are used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts. The C++ Standard Library places all its components within the std namespace.
